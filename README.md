# survivor-picker

Weekly pick recommendations for an NFL survivor pool, for two entries
(`Entry A`, `Entry B`) in the same private pool. This tool only prints
recommendations -- it never submits a pick anywhere. You still make the
actual pick in your pool's site/app.

## View this week's report (no coding required)

This repo automatically publishes the weekly report as a webpage via
GitHub Pages, refreshed every Tuesday and Friday, or on demand.

**One-time setup** (a repo admin only has to do this once):

1. On GitHub, go to this repo's **Settings** tab.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
3. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", choose **GitHub Actions**.

After that, the page updates itself automatically -- nothing more to do.
The report's URL will be shown at the top of Settings → Pages once the
first run completes (it looks like
`https://<your-github-username>.github.io/algorithm-testing/`).

**To refresh it right now** instead of waiting for the schedule: go to
this repo's **Actions** tab, click **Weekly Survivor Report** in the left
list, then click the **Run workflow** button.

Because this repo is public, the published page (and the picks recorded
in `state/`) are visible to anyone with the link -- there's nothing
sensitive in it (just team abbreviations and win probabilities), but
worth knowing.

## How it works

`data/espn_client.py` pulls three things from ESPN's unofficial (undocumented)
API for the current week:

1. Schedule and live scores -- `site.api.espn.com/.../scoreboard`
2. Win probabilities -- `sports.core.api.espn.com/.../probabilities`
3. Odds/spread -- `sports.core.api.espn.com/.../odds`

Because these endpoints are unofficial, the client is conservative about
request volume and defensive about parsing:

- **Caching**: every response is cached to a JSON file under `cache/`,
  refreshed at most every `CACHE_TTL_HOURS` (default 4h, see `config.py`).
  If a live fetch fails, the client falls back to whatever is cached on
  disk, even if stale, instead of failing the whole run.
- **Retries**: outbound requests use `urllib3.Retry` with exponential
  backoff on connection errors and 429/5xx responses, plus a small
  self-imposed minimum delay between requests.
- **Graceful field fallback**: all JSON field access goes through a safe
  getter, so a missing or renamed field from ESPN degrades to `None`
  instead of crashing. If win probability isn't available yet, the
  recommender falls back to a rough estimate from the betting spread.

`picker/recommender.py` ranks each team not yet used by an entry by win
probability (highest first) and flags if both entries' top pick is the
same team, so you can diversify.

`models/win_prob.py` builds a clean, per-team, per-week win probability
table for the season: it prefers ESPN's own probability field (normalized
to a 0-100 scale) and falls back to a spread-derived estimate when ESPN
hasn't published one yet, tagging each entry with its `source` so callers
know how much to trust it.

`models/future_value.py` scores whether a team is worth holding back:
given a team's remaining schedule, it looks ahead (default 6 weeks,
weighted heaviest in the next 4-6) and compares the best discounted future
matchup to using that team this week. A positive `future_value` means a
better spot is likely coming -- this is what a future optimizer would use
to avoid burning a strong team too early.

`state/used_teams_a.json` and `state/used_teams_b.json` track each entry's
picks across the season -- one file per entry, so their histories stay
independent. Each file is a list of `{"week": <int>, "team": <abbreviation>}`
entries (storing the week, not just the team, is what makes the pick
history/win-loss table below possible). This is local file state you
update yourself via `record-pick` after you make your real pick elsewhere
-- survivor-picker never touches your pool.

`pick_history.py` resolves each recorded pick against ESPN's actual result
for that week (win / loss / tie / still pending), by looking up that
team's game and comparing scores -- read-only, same as the rest of the
report. `main.py show-history` and the published report both use it to
show a week-by-week table with each entry's running win-loss record.

`strategy/entry_a_value.py` is Entry A's weekly pick strategy: it scores
each not-yet-used team as `win_pct * (1 - future_value_penalty)`, where the
penalty (capped, see `MAX_FUTURE_VALUE_PENALTY`) comes from `future_value.py`
-- so a team with an even better matchup coming up in the next few weeks
gets discounted rather than automatically recommended now. It returns the
top pick plus plain-English reasoning (win prob, spread, and why it beat
the next-best alternative).

`strategy/entry_b_hedge.py` is the lightweight, sequential way to pick for
Entry B: treat Entry A's pick as already fixed, then take Entry B's
highest win-probability team from a *different* game (so a single result
can't eliminate both entries), as long as it clears a minimum win-probability
floor (default 65%). If nothing clears the floor, the floor is relaxed
rather than leaving Entry B without a pick, and that's called out in the
reasoning.

`strategy/joint_optimizer.py` is the real joint optimization: instead of
fixing Entry A's pick first, it brute-force searches every valid
`(team_a, team_b)` pair -- never a used team, never the same team twice,
never two teams from the same game -- and picks the one that maximizes
`P(A wins) + P(B wins) - P(A loses AND B loses)` (independence assumed
between the two picks' games, which always holds here since they're
required to be different games). Entry B's win probability still has to
clear the same configurable floor. Output includes both picks, the
reasoning, and the estimated "both survive" / "one survives" / "both
eliminated" probabilities for the week.

`main.py`'s `weekly` command ties all of the above into one pipeline: fetch
this week's games plus the next few weeks (for the look-ahead report),
build the win-probability table, run the joint optimizer, print a report,
and -- only if you confirm -- record the picks into the state files. Steps:

1. Fetch the current week (+ `--lookahead-weeks`, default 3, more weeks)
   from ESPN via `data/espn_client.py` (cached, retried, rate-limited).
2. Build the season win-probability table (`models/win_prob.py`).
3. Run `strategy/joint_optimizer.py` for this week's recommended pair.
4. Find teams playing this week that are available to at least one entry,
   aren't this week's picks, and have a genuinely better matchup projected
   within the look-ahead window (`models/future_value.py`'s `should_hold`).
5. Print the report: both picks with win probabilities and spreads, the
   both-survive/one-survives/both-eliminated breakdown, each entry's
   remaining team pool (all 32 teams minus used ones), the held-back
   teams' best upcoming matchup, and the full pick history with win/loss
   results (`pick_history.py`).
6. Prompt to confirm before writing anything -- only on "y" does it call
   `state/entries_store.py`'s `record_pick` for both entries. Nothing is
   ever recorded, and nothing is ever submitted to your pool, without that
   confirmation (or `--yes` if you want to skip the prompt).

`report.py` holds steps 1-5 above as reusable, read-only functions (never
writes state) -- both `main.py weekly` (terminal report + optional
confirm-and-record) and `generate_report.py` (a static HTML page, styled
for light/dark and mobile) build on it, so the two never drift apart.
`.github/workflows/weekly-report.yml` runs `generate_report.py` on a
schedule and publishes the result to GitHub Pages -- see "View this
week's report" above.

## How many entries should you buy? (portfolio analysis)

Separate from the weekly picker: `simulate_portfolio.py` answers a
before-the-season question -- how many entries (each $10, all bought
before the season starts, no repeat teams within an entry) maximizes the
chance that *at least one* of them survives the entire season?

It sweeps entry counts 1..N: every week, every live entry takes the best
team it hasn't used yet, next-best on a collision with another of your
own entries (`analysis/portfolio_simulator.py` -- a generalization of
`strategy/joint_optimizer.py` from 2 entries to N, deliberately *not*
excluding two of your entries landing on opposite sides of the same
game, since for "at least one survives" that actually guarantees one of
them wins that week). This tool doesn't model your ~300 pool competitors
or a payout split -- it purely answers "does at least one of my entries
go all the way," independent of anyone else. The result is a
diminishing-returns curve: each additional entry helps, but by less each
time, since diversification runs out of good teams for the marginal
entry sooner.

Two data sources for the underlying seasons:

```bash
# Real: the 10 most recently completed NFL seasons (2016-2025), closing
# spreads from nflverse/nfldata's public games.csv, converted to win
# probability via the same spread-to-win% formula the synthetic model
# uses. Fetches fresh from GitHub each run unless you pass --games-csv.
python simulate_portfolio.py --source real --years 2016-2025 --trials-per-season 10000

# Synthetic: a randomized season generator (analysis/synthetic_season.py),
# run many times for statistical smoothness. Doesn't depend on any
# external data -- useful as a large-sample reference, and it's what this
# tool used before real data was wired in (consistently a bit more
# optimistic than what actually happened).
python simulate_portfolio.py --source synthetic --max-entries 10 --trials-per-season 1000 --num-seasons 100
```

`--out` writes the full sweep to JSON either way, if you want to chart or
dig into it further. `analysis/nflverse_games.py` is the real-data loader
(`fetch_and_load_seasons` / `load_seasons_from_file`); both sources
funnel into the same `run_sweep_on_seasons` in `analysis/portfolio_simulator.py`,
so the two are directly comparable.

ESPN's own API (`data/espn_client.py`) only has the current week and a
short look-ahead, and this dev environment is blocked by organization
policy from reaching it at all -- confirmed with a 403 policy denial on
the CONNECT tunnel, not a transient failure. `analysis/fetch_historical_season.py`
+ `.github/workflows/fetch-historical-season.yml` exist as an alternative
real-data path that runs the fetch inside GitHub Actions instead (which
has normal internet access, the same way the weekly-report workflow
does) -- but in practice ESPN's API returned essentially nothing for old
completed seasons (a 298-byte result for a 10-year request), so
nflverse's games.csv is the one actually in use.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Full weekly pipeline: fetch, score, optimize, report, confirm-and-record
python main.py weekly

# A specific week, a longer look-ahead, a stricter Entry B floor
python main.py weekly --week 3 --lookahead-weeks 4 --min-win-prob-floor-b 70

# Skip the confirmation prompt (still prints the report first)
python main.py weekly --yes

# Print ranked recommendations for the current week (no optimization, no state changes)
python main.py recommend

# A specific week
python main.py recommend --week 3

# After you've actually made a pick in your pool, record it so future
# weeks exclude that team for that entry (week defaults to the current one)
python main.py record-pick --entry "Entry A" --team KC
python main.py record-pick --entry "Entry A" --team KC --week 5

# See what's already been used, plus the win/loss history for every
# recorded pick
python main.py show-history

# Generate the static HTML report by hand (this is what the GitHub Actions
# workflow runs automatically -- you shouldn't normally need to run it
# yourself, but it's here if you want to preview docs/index.html locally)
python generate_report.py --out docs/index.html
```

## Notes on being a good API citizen

ESPN does not publish or support these endpoints. This project keeps
request volume low on purpose: aggressive caching (hours, not minutes),
retry/backoff instead of hammering on failure, and a minimum delay
between outbound requests. If you lower `CACHE_TTL_HOURS`, keep it
reasonable -- there's no need to re-fetch more than a few times a day
outside of live game windows.
